# 📌 Project 2: Fall Detection System (Video Classification)

## 🔹 Description
This project focuses on automated fall detection using deep learning and computer vision techniques for healthcare monitoring and intelligent surveillance systems. The system analyzes video input and classifies human activities into two categories: **Fall and Non-Fall**, enabling timely detection and response in critical situations.

The project uses a multi-camera video dataset where frames are extracted and processed to capture spatial features for classification. Multiple deep learning models are implemented and compared to evaluate performance.
